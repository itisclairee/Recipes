##  :link: **UIKit and SwiftUI**

The primary motivation behind developing Ciao Chef! was to experiment and learn more about the integration of UIKit and SwiftUI. By creating this app, we wanted to be able to integrate new SwiftUI views into an already existing UIKit project. When working with storyboards in UIKit, we can use a Hosting Controller from the object library to present a SwiftUI view hierarchy. The controller created in the storyboard can be prepared for presentation inside the storyboard segue action.
